A Streamline plot is a representation based on a 2-D vector field interpreted as a velocity field, consisting of closed curves tangent to the velocity field. In the case of a stationary velocity field, streamlines coincide with trajectories (see also the [Wikipedia page on streamlines, streaklines and pathlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamlines,_streaklines,_and_pathlines)).

For the streamline [figure factory](../figure-factories/), one needs to provide
- uniformly spaced ranges of `x` and `y` values (1D)
- 2-D velocity values `u` and `v` defined on the cross-product (`np.meshgrid(x, y)`) of `x` and `y`.

Velocity values are interpolated when determining the streamlines. Streamlines are initialized on the boundary of the `x-y` domain.

#### Basic Streamline Plot

Streamline plots can be made with a [figure factory](../figure-factories/) as detailed in this page.

```python
import plotly.figure_factory as ff

import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
y = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
Y, X = np.meshgrid(x, y)
u = -1 - X**2 + Y
v = 1 + X - Y**2

# Create streamline figure
fig = ff.create_streamline(x, y, u, v, arrow_scale=.1)
fig.show()
```

#### Streamline and Source Point Plot

```python
import plotly.figure_factory as ff
import plotly.graph_objects as go

import numpy as np

N = 50
x_start, x_end = -2.0, 2.0
y_start, y_end = -1.0, 1.0
x = np.linspace(x_start, x_end, N)
y = np.linspace(y_start, y_end, N)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
source_strength = 5.0
x_source, y_source = -1.0, 0.0

# Compute the velocity field on the mesh grid
u = (source_strength/(2*np.pi) *
     (X - x_source)/((X - x_source)**2 + (Y - y_source)**2))
v = (source_strength/(2*np.pi) *
     (Y - y_source)/((X - x_source)**2 + (Y - y_source)**2))

# Create streamline figure
fig = ff.create_streamline(x, y, u, v,
                           name='streamline')

# Add source point
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=[x_source], y=[y_source],
                          mode='markers',
                          marker_size=14,
                          name='source point'))

fig.show()
```
