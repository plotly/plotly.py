### Overview

The [`plotly` Python library](/python/) is an interactive, [open-source](/python/is-plotly-free) plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.

Built on top of the Plotly JavaScript library ([plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/)), `plotly` enables Python users to create beautiful interactive web-based visualizations that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks, saved to standalone HTML files, or served as part of pure Python-built web applications using Dash. The `plotly` Python library is sometimes referred to as "plotly.py" to differentiate it from the JavaScript library.

Thanks to deep integration with our [Kaleido](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido) image export utility, `plotly` also provides great support for non-web contexts including desktop editors (e.g. QtConsole, Spyder, PyCharm) and static document publishing (e.g. exporting notebooks to PDF with high-quality vector images).

This Getting Started guide explains how to install `plotly` and related optional pages. Once you've installed, you can use our documentation in three main ways:

1. You jump right in to **examples** of how to make [basic charts](/python/basic-charts/), [statistical charts](/python/statistical-charts/), [scientific charts](/python/scientific-charts/), [financial charts](/python/financial-charts/), [maps](/python/maps/), and [3-dimensional charts](/python/3d-charts/).
2. If you prefer to learn about the **fundamentals** of the library first, you can read about [the structure of figures](/python/figure-structure/), [how to create and update figures](/python/creating-and-updating-figures/), [how to display figures](/python/renderers/), [how to theme figures with templates](/python/templates/), [how to export figures to various formats](/python/static-image-export/) and about [Plotly Express, the high-level API](/python/plotly-express/) for doing all of the above.
3. You can check out our exhaustive **reference** guides: the [Python API reference](/python-api-reference) or the [Figure Reference](/python/reference)

For information on using Python to build web applications containing plotly figures, see the [_Dash User Guide_](https://dash.plotly.com/).

We also encourage you to join the [Plotly Community Forum](http://community.plotly.com/) if you want help with anything related to `plotly`.

### Installation

`plotly` may be installed using `pip`:

```
$ pip install plotly
```

or `conda`:

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge plotly
```

If you want to use Plotly Express, install its required dependencies with:

```
pip install plotly[express]
```

You'll also need to install a [supported dataframe library](/python/px-arguments#supported-dataFrame-types).

### Plotly charts in Dash

[Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) is the best way to build analytical apps in Python using Plotly figures. To run the app below, run `pip install dash`, click "Download" to get the code and run `python app.py`.

Get started  with [the official Dash docs](https://dash.plotly.com/installation) and **learn how to effortlessly [style](https://plotly.com/dash/design-kit/) & publish apps like this with <a class="plotly-red" href="https://plotly.com/dash/">Dash Enterprise</a> or <a class="plotly-red" href="https://plotly.com/cloud/">Plotly Cloud</a>.**

#### JupyterLab Support

To use `plotly` in [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), install the `jupyterlab` and `anywidget` packages in the same environment as you installed `plotly`, using `pip`:

```
$ pip install jupyterlab anywidget
```

or `conda`:

```
$ conda install jupyterlab anywidget
```

Launch JupyterLab with:

```
$ jupyter lab
```

and display plotly figures inline:

```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.bar(x=["a", "b", "c"], y=[1, 3, 2])
fig.show()
```

or using `FigureWidget` objects.

```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.bar(x=["a", "b", "c"], y=[1, 3, 2])

import plotly.graph_objects as go
fig_widget = go.FigureWidget(fig)
fig_widget
```

See [_Displaying Figures in Python_](/python/renderers/) for more information on the renderers framework, and see [_Plotly FigureWidget Overview_](/python/figurewidget/) for more information on using `FigureWidget`.

See the [Troubleshooting guide](/python/troubleshooting/) if you run into any problems with JupyterLab, particularly if you are using multiple Python environments inside Jupyter.


#### Jupyter Notebook Support

For use in the classic [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), install the `notebook` and `ipywidgets`
packages using `pip`:

```
pip install "notebook>=7.0" "anywidget>=0.9.13"
```

or `conda`:

```
conda install "notebook>=7.0" "anywidget>=0.9.13"
```

These packages contain everything you need to run a Jupyter notebook...

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

and display plotly figures inline using the notebook renderer...


```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.bar(x=["a", "b", "c"], y=[1, 3, 2])
fig.show()
```

or using `FigureWidget` objects.

```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.bar(x=["a", "b", "c"], y=[1, 3, 2])

import plotly.graph_objects as go
fig_widget = go.FigureWidget(fig)
fig_widget
```

See [_Displaying Figures in Python_](/python/renderers/) for more information on the renderers framework, and see [_Plotly FigureWidget Overview_](/python/figurewidget/) for more information on using `FigureWidget`.


### Static Image Export

plotly.py supports [static image export](https://plotly.com/python/static-image-export/),
using the [`kaleido`](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido) package. (Support for the legacy [`orca`](https://github.com/plotly/orca) image export utility is deprecated and will be removed after September 2025.)

#### Kaleido

The [`kaleido`](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido) package has no dependencies and can be installed
using pip...

```
$ pip install --upgrade kaleido
```

or conda.

```
$ conda install -c plotly python-kaleido
```

#### Extended Geo Support

Some plotly.py features rely on fairly large geographic shape files. The county
choropleth figure factory is one such example. These shape files are distributed as a
separate `plotly-geo` package. This package can be installed using pip...

```
$ pip install plotly-geo==1.0.0
```

or conda.

```
$ conda install -c plotly plotly-geo=1.0.0
```

See [_USA County Choropleth Maps in Python_](/python/county-choropleth/) for more information on the county choropleth figure factory.
