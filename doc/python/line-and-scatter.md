## Scatter plots with Plotly Express

[Plotly Express](/python/plotly-express/) is the easy-to-use, high-level interface to Plotly, which [operates on a variety of types of data](/python/px-arguments/) and produces [easy-to-style figures](/python/styling-plotly-express/).

With `px.scatter`, each data point is represented as a marker point, whose location is given by the `x` and `y` columns.

```python
# x and y given as array_like objects
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter(x=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], y=[0, 1, 4, 9, 16])
fig.show()
```

```python
# x and y given as DataFrame columns
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris() # iris is a pandas DataFrame
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length")
fig.show()
```

#### Setting size and color with column names

Scatter plots with variable-sized circular markers are often known as [bubble charts](https://plotly.com/python/bubble-charts/). Note that `color` and `size` data are added to hover information. You can add other columns to hover data with the `hover_data` argument of `px.scatter`.

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species",
                 size='petal_length', hover_data=['petal_width'])
fig.show()
```

Color can be [continuous](https://plotly.com/python/colorscales/) as follows, or [discrete/categorical](https://plotly.com/python/discrete-color/) as above.

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color='petal_length')
fig.show()
```

The `symbol` argument can be mapped to a column as well. A [wide variety of symbols](https://plotly.com/python/marker-style/) are available.

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species", symbol="species")
fig.show()
```

### Scatter plots and Categorical Axes

Scatter plots can be made using any type of cartesian axis, including [linear](https://plotly.com/python/axes/), [logarithmic](https://plotly.com/python/log-plot/), [categorical](https://plotly.com/python/categorical-axes/) or [date](https://plotly.com/python/time-series/) axes.

Scatter plots where one axis is categorical are often known as [dot plots](https://plotly.com/python/dot-plots/).

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.medals_long()

fig = px.scatter(df, y="nation", x="count", color="medal", symbol="medal")
fig.update_traces(marker_size=10)
fig.show()
```

### Grouped Scatter Points

*New in 5.12*

By default, scatter points at the same location are overlayed. We can see this in the previous example, with the values for Canada for bronze and silver. Set `scattermode='group'` to plot scatter points next to one another, centered around the shared location.

```python
import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.medals_long()

fig = px.scatter(df, y="count", x="nation", color="medal")
fig.update_traces(marker_size=10)
fig.update_layout(scattermode="group")
fig.show()
```

*New in 5.12*

You can configure the gap between groups of scatter points using `scattergap`. Here we set it to `0.75`, which brings the points closer together by allocating more space to the gap between groups. If you don't set `scattergap`, a default value of `0` is used, unless you have `bargap` set. If you have `bargap` set, the `scattergap` defaults to that value.


```python
import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.medals_long()

fig = px.scatter(df, y="count", x="nation", color="medal")
fig.update_traces(marker_size=10)
fig.update_layout(scattermode="group", scattergap=0.75)
fig.show()
```

### Error Bars

Scatter plots support [error bars](https://plotly.com/python/error-bars/).

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()
df["e"] = df["sepal_width"]/100
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species",
                 error_x="e", error_y="e")
fig.show()
```

### Marginal Distribution Plots

Scatter plots support [marginal distribution plots](https://plotly.com/python/marginal-plots/)

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_length", y="sepal_width", marginal_x="histogram", marginal_y="rug")
fig.show()
```

### Facetting

Scatter plots support [faceting](https://plotly.com/python/facet-plots/).

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.tips()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="total_bill", y="tip", color="smoker", facet_col="sex", facet_row="time")
fig.show()
```

### Linear Regression and Other Trendlines

Scatter plots support [linear and non-linear trendlines](https://plotly.com/python/linear-fits/).

```python
import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.tips()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="total_bill", y="tip", trendline="ols")
fig.show()
```

## Line plots with Plotly Express

```python
import plotly.express as px
import numpy as np

t = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)

fig = px.line(x=t, y=np.cos(t), labels={'x':'t', 'y':'cos(t)'})
fig.show()
```

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.gapminder().query("continent == 'Oceania'")
fig = px.line(df, x='year', y='lifeExp', color='country')
fig.show()
```

The `markers` argument can be set to `True` to show markers on lines.

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.gapminder().query("continent == 'Oceania'")
fig = px.line(df, x='year', y='lifeExp', color='country', markers=True)
fig.show()
```

The `symbol` argument can be used to map a data field to the marker symbol. A [wide variety of symbols](https://plotly.com/python/marker-style/) are available.

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.gapminder().query("continent == 'Oceania'")
fig = px.line(df, x='year', y='lifeExp', color='country', symbol="country")
fig.show()
```

### Line plots on Date axes

Line plots can be made on using any type of cartesian axis, including [linear](https://plotly.com/python/axes/), [logarithmic](https://plotly.com/python/log-plot/), [categorical](https://plotly.com/python/categorical-axes/) or date axes. Line plots on date axes are often called [time-series charts](https://plotly.com/python/time-series/).

Plotly auto-sets the axis type to a date format when the corresponding data are either ISO-formatted date strings or if they're a [date pandas column](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html) or [datetime NumPy array](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.datetime.html).

```python
import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.stocks()
fig = px.line(df, x='date', y="GOOG")
fig.show()
```

### Data Order in Scatter and Line Charts

Plotly line charts are implemented as [connected scatterplots](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/connectedscatter.html) (see below), meaning that the points are plotted and connected with lines **in the order they are provided, with no automatic reordering**.

This makes it possible to make charts like the one below, but also means that it may be required to explicitly sort data before passing it to Plotly to avoid lines moving "backwards" across the chart.

```python
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(dict(
    x = [1, 3, 2, 4],
    y = [1, 2, 3, 4]
))
fig = px.line(df, x="x", y="y", title="Unsorted Input")
fig.show()

df = df.sort_values(by="x")
fig = px.line(df, x="x", y="y", title="Sorted Input")
fig.show()
```

### Connected Scatterplots

In a connected scatterplot, two continuous variables are plotted against each other, with a line connecting them in some meaningful order, usually a time variable. In the plot below, we show the "trajectory" of a pair of countries through a space defined by GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy. Botswana's life expectancy

```python
import plotly.express as px

df = px.data.gapminder().query("country in ['Canada', 'Botswana']")

fig = px.line(df, x="lifeExp", y="gdpPercap", color="country", text="year")
fig.update_traces(textposition="bottom right")
fig.show()
```

### Swarm (or Beeswarm) Plots 

Swarm plots show the distribution of values in a column by giving each entry one dot and adjusting the y-value so that dots do not overlap and appear symmetrically around the y=0 line. They complement [histograms](https://plotly.com/python/histograms/), [box plots](https://plotly.com/python/box-plots/), and [violin plots](https://plotly.com/python/violin/). This example could be generalized to implement a swarm plot for multiple categories by adjusting the y-coordinate for each category.

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import collections


def negative_1_if_count_is_odd(count):
    # if this is an odd numbered entry in its bin, make its y coordinate negative
    # the y coordinate of the first entry is 0, so entries 3, 5, and 7 get 
    # negative y coordinates
    if count % 2 == 1:
        return -1
    else:
        return 1


def swarm(
    X_series,
    fig_title,
    point_size=16,
    fig_width=800,
    gap_multiplier=1.2,
    bin_fraction=0.95,  # slightly undersizes the bins to avoid collisions
):
    # sorting will align columns in attractive c-shaped arcs rather than having 
    # columns that vary unpredictably in the x-dimension.
    # We also exploit the fact that sorting means we see bins sequentially when 
    # we add collision prevention offsets.
    X_series = X_series.copy().sort_values()

    # we need to reason in terms of the marker size that is measured in px
    # so we need to think about each x-coordinate as being a fraction of the way from the
    # minimum X value to the maximum X value
    min_x = min(X_series)
    max_x = max(X_series)

    list_of_rows = []
    # we will count the number of points in each "bin" / vertical strip of the graph
    # to be able to assign a y-coordinate that avoids overlapping
    bin_counter = collections.Counter()

    for x_val in X_series:
        # assign this x_value to bin number
        # each bin is a vertical strip slightly narrower than one marker
        bin = (((fig_width*bin_fraction*(x_val-min_x))/(max_x-min_x)) // point_size)

        # update the count of dots in that strip
        bin_counter.update([bin])

        # remember the "y-slot" which tells us the number of points in this bin and is sufficient to compute the y coordinate unless there's a collision with the point to its left
        list_of_rows.append(
            {"x": x_val, "y_slot": bin_counter[bin], "bin": bin})

    # iterate through the points and "offset" any that are colliding with a 
    # point to their left apply the offsets to all subsequent points in the same bin.
    # this arranges points in an attractive swarm c-curve where the points 
    # toward the edges are (weakly) further right.
    bin = 0
    offset = 0
    for row in list_of_rows:
        if bin != row["bin"]:
            # we have moved to a new bin, so we need to reset the offset
            bin = row["bin"]
            offset = 0
        # see if we need to "look left" to avoid a possible collision
        for other_row in list_of_rows:
            if (other_row["bin"] == bin-1):
                # "bubble" the entry up until we find a slot that avoids a collision
                while ((other_row["y_slot"] == row["y_slot"]+offset)
                       and (((fig_width*(row["x"]-other_row["x"]))/(max_x-min_x)
                              // point_size) < 1)):
                    offset += 1
                    # update the bin count so we know whether the number of 
                    # *used* slots is even or odd
                    bin_counter.update([bin])

        row["y_slot"] += offset
        # The collision free y coordinate gives the items in a vertical bin
        # y-coordinates to evenly spread their locations above and below the 
        # y-axis (we'll make a correction below to deal with even numbers of 
        # entries).  For now, we'll assign 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3 ... and so on.
        # We scale this by the point_size*gap_multiplier to get a y coordinate 
        # in px.
        row["y"] = (row["y_slot"]//2) * \
            negative_1_if_count_is_odd(row["y_slot"])*point_size*gap_multiplier

    # if the number of points is even, move y-coordinates down to put an equal 
    # number of entries above and below the axis
    for row in list_of_rows:
        if bin_counter[row["bin"]] % 2 == 0:
            row["y"] -= point_size*gap_multiplier/2

    df = pd.DataFrame(list_of_rows)
    # One way to make this code more flexible to e.g. handle multiple categories
    # would be to return a list of "swarmified" y coordinates here and then plot
    # outside the function.
    # That generalization would let you "swarmify" y coordinates for each 
    # category and add category specific offsets to put the each category in its 
    # own row

    fig = px.scatter(
        df,
        x="x",
        y="y",
        title=fig_title,
    )
    # we want to suppress the y coordinate in the hover value because the 
    # y-coordinate is irrelevant/misleading
    fig.update_traces(
        marker_size=point_size,
        # suppress the y coordinate because the y-coordinate is irrelevant
        hovertemplate="<b>value</b>: %{x}",
    )
    # we have to set the width and height because we aim to avoid icon collisions
    # and we specify the icon size in the same units as the width and height
    fig.update_layout(width=fig_width, height=(
        point_size*max(bin_counter.values())+200))
    fig.update_yaxes(
        showticklabels=False,  # Turn off y-axis labels
        ticks='',               # Remove the ticks
        title=""
    )
    return fig


df = px.data.iris()  # iris is a pandas DataFrame
fig = swarm(df["sepal_length"], "Sepal length distribution from 150 iris samples")
# The iris data set entries are rounded so there are no collisions.
# a more interesting test case for collision avoidance is:
# fig = swarm(pd.Series([1, 1.5, 1.78, 1.79, 1.85, 2,
#            2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2.05, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 12]))
fig.show()
```

## Scatter and line plots with go.Scatter

If Plotly Express does not provide a good starting point, it is possible to use [the more generic `go.Scatter` class from `plotly.graph_objects`](/python/graph-objects/). Whereas `plotly.express` has two functions `scatter` and `line`, `go.Scatter` can be used both for plotting points (makers) or lines, depending on the value of `mode`. The different options of `go.Scatter` are documented in its [reference page](https://plotly.com/python/reference/scatter/).

#### Simple Scatter Plot

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import numpy as np

N = 1000
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(t)

fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(x=t, y=y, mode='markers'))

fig.show()
```

#### Line and Scatter Plots

Use `mode` argument to choose between markers, lines, or a combination of both. For more options about line plots, see also the [line charts notebook](https://plotly.com/python/line-charts/) and the [filled area plots notebook](https://plotly.com/python/filled-area-plots/).

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Create random data with numpy
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(1)

N = 100
random_x = np.linspace(0, 1, N)
random_y0 = np.random.randn(N) + 5
random_y1 = np.random.randn(N)
random_y2 = np.random.randn(N) - 5

fig = go.Figure()

# Add traces
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=random_x, y=random_y0,
                    mode='markers',
                    name='markers'))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=random_x, y=random_y1,
                    mode='lines+markers',
                    name='lines+markers'))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=random_x, y=random_y2,
                    mode='lines',
                    name='lines'))

fig.show()
```

#### Bubble Scatter Plots

In [bubble charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart), a third dimension of the data is shown through the size of markers. For more examples, see the [bubble chart notebook](https://plotly.com/python/bubble-charts/)

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(
    x=[1, 2, 3, 4],
    y=[10, 11, 12, 13],
    mode='markers',
    marker=dict(size=[40, 60, 80, 100],
                color=[0, 1, 2, 3])
))

fig.show()
```

#### Style Scatter Plots

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import numpy as np


t = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)

fig = go.Figure()

fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x=t, y=np.sin(t),
    name='sin',
    mode='markers',
    marker_color='rgba(152, 0, 0, .8)'
))

fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
    x=t, y=np.cos(t),
    name='cos',
    marker_color='rgba(255, 182, 193, .9)'
))

# Set options common to all traces with fig.update_traces
fig.update_traces(mode='markers', marker_line_width=2, marker_size=10)
fig.update_layout(title=dict(text='Styled Scatter'),
                  yaxis_zeroline=False, xaxis_zeroline=False)


fig.show()
```

#### Data Labels on Hover

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import pandas as pd

data= pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2014_usa_states.csv")

fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(x=data['Postal'],
                                y=data['Population'],
                                mode='markers',
                                marker_color=data['Population'],
                                text=data['State'])) # hover text goes here

fig.update_layout(title=dict(text='Population of USA States'))
fig.show()

```

#### Scatter with a Color Dimension

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import numpy as np

fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(
    y = np.random.randn(500),
    mode='markers',
    marker=dict(
        size=16,
        color=np.random.randn(500), #set color equal to a variable
        colorscale='Viridis', # one of plotly colorscales
        showscale=True
    )
))

fig.show()
```

#### Trace Zorder

*New in 5.21*

For many trace types, including `go.Scatter`, you can define the order traces are drawn in by setting a `zorder`. Traces with a higher `zorder` appear at the front, with traces with a lower `zorder` at the back. In this example, we give our trace for 'France' the highest `zorder`, meaning it is drawn in front of the other two traces:

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.data as data

df = data.gapminder()

df_europe = df[df['continent'] == 'Europe']

trace1 = go.Scatter(x=df_europe[df_europe['country'] == 'France']['year'],
                    y=df_europe[df_europe['country'] == 'France']['lifeExp'],
                    mode='lines+markers',
                    zorder=3,
                    name='France',
                    marker=dict(size=15))

trace2 = go.Scatter(x=df_europe[df_europe['country'] == 'Germany']['year'],
                    y=df_europe[df_europe['country'] == 'Germany']['lifeExp'],
                    mode='lines+markers',
                    zorder=1,
                    name='Germany',
                    marker=dict(size=15))

trace3 = go.Scatter(x=df_europe[df_europe['country'] == 'Spain']['year'],
                    y=df_europe[df_europe['country'] == 'Spain']['lifeExp'],
                    mode='lines+markers',
                    zorder=2,
                    name='Spain',
                    marker=dict(size=15))

layout = go.Layout(title=dict(text='Life Expectancy in Europe Over Time'))

fig = go.Figure(data=[trace1, trace2, trace3], layout=layout)

fig.show()
```

#### Large Data Sets

Now in Plotly you can implement WebGL with `Scattergl()` in place of `Scatter()` <br>
for increased speed, improved interactivity, and the ability to plot even more data!

```python
