#### Create a New View for Output


Display a FigureWidget and then create a new window to display it in so that you can scroll through your code but still keep an eye on what you're doing.

#### View Live Updates

With the output view it is easy to take full advantage of FigureWidgets new imperative-style graph updates since you can see your code and your graph at the same time.
