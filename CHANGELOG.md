## [4.0.0] - 2019-07-16

This is a major release that includes many new features, and a few breaking changes. See the [version 4 announcement](https://community.plot.ly/t/introducing-plotly-py-4-0-0rc1/25639) for a summary of the important changes.

### Updated
 - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.48.3. See the
 [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1483----2019-06-13)
 for more information.

### Added
 - The Plotly Express tech preview (https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-plotly-express-808df010143d) has been integrated as the `plotly.express` module ([#1613](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1613))
 - Added a new renderers framework the supports rendering figure in a wide variety of contexts ([#1474](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1474)). See the new [Displaying Plotly Figures](https://plot.ly/python/next/renderers) documentation page for more information.
 - Added `plotly.io.write_html` and `plotly.io.to_html` functions for exporting figures to HTML ([1474](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1474)). Also available as `.write_html` and `.to_html` figure methods.
 - Added new figure methods for batch updating figure properties (`update_layout`, `update_traces`, `update_xaxes`, etc.) ([#1624](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1624)).  See the new [Creating and Updating Figures](https://plot.ly/python/next/creating-and-updating-figures/) documentation page for more details.
 - Added support for all trace types in `make_subplots` ([#1528](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1528))
 - Added support for secondary y-axes in `make_subplots` ([#1564](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1564))
 - Support passing a scalar trace object (rather than a list or tuple of trace objects) as the `data` property to the `Figure` constructor ([#1614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1614))
 - Added dictionary-stule `.pop` method to graph object classes ([#1614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1614))
 - New `jupyterlab-plotly` JupyterLab extension for rendering figures in JupyterLab. Replaces the `@jupyterlab/plotly-extension` extension, and includes JupyterLab 1.0 support.
 - Added new suite of built-in colorscales to the `plotly.colors` module, and support for specifying this wide range of colorscales by name. Also added support for specifying colorscales as a list of colors, in which case the color spacing is assumed to be uniform ([#1647](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1647)).
 - Added `sphinx-gallery` renderer for embedding plotly figures in [Sphinx-Gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/) ([#1577](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1577), [plotly/plotly-sphinx-gallery](https://github.com/plotly/plotly-sphinx-gallery)).
 
### Removed
 - The follow modules for interfacing with the Chart Studio cloud service have been removed from plotly.py and moved to the new `chart-studio` distribution package.  The following modules have been moved to a new top-level `chart_studio` module:
   - `plotly.plotly` -> `chart_studio.plotly`
   - `plotly.api` -> `chart_studio.api`
   - `plotly.dashboard_objs` -> `chart_studio.dashboard_objs`
   - `plotly.grid_objs` -> `chart_studio.grid_objs`
   - `plotly.presentation_objs` -> `chart_studio.presentation_objs`
 - The legacy `plotly.widgets.GraphWidget` class for displaying online figures hosted by Chart Studio as ipywidgets has been removed. Please use the offline, and much more capable, `plotly.graph_objects.FigureWidget` class instead.
 - The `fileopt` argument to `chart_studio.plotly.plot` has been removed, so in-place modifications to previously published figures are no longer supported, and a figure will always overwrite a figure with the same name. 

### Changed
 - The `'plotly'` template is used as the default theme across all figures.
 - In order to reduce the size of the core `plotly` distribution package, the bundled geographic shape files used by the `create_choropleth` figure factory have been moved to a new optional `plotly-geo` distribution package ([1604](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1604))
 - For consistency with other figure factories, the `create_choropleth`  and `create_gantt` figure factories now always returns `Figure` objects, rather than dictionaries ([#1600](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1600), [#1607](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1607)).
 - Figure add trace methods (`.add_trace`, `.add_traces`, `.add_scatter`, etc.) now return a reference to the calling figure, rather than the newly created trace ([#1624](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1624))
 - `plotly.tools.make_subplots` has been moved to `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`, though it is still available at the previous location for backward compatibility
 - The `plotly.graph_objs` module has been moved to `plotly.graph_objects`, though it is still available at the previous location for backward compatibility ([#1614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1614))
 - Trace `uid` properties are only generated automatically when a trace is added to a `FigureWidget`.  When a trace is added to a standard `Figure` graph object the input `uid`, if provided, is accepted as is ([#1580](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1580)).
 - `datetime` objects that include timezones are not longer converted to UTC ([#1581](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1581))
 - When a tuple property (e.g. `layout.annotations`) is updated with a list/tuple that is longer than the current value, the extra elements are appended to the end of the tuple.

### Fixed
 - Fixed visibility of `bar` trace error bars in built-in templates ([1656](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1656))

 whether figures with frames are automatically animated when the figure is
 loaded
 ([#1447](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1447))
 - Added support for uploading "offline" animations (those with inline data
 arrays rather than grid references) to Chart Studio using `plotly.plotly.create_animations`
 ([#1432](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1432))
 
### Updated
 - Updated implementation of the `ternary_contour` figure factory that was
 added in 3.6.0. The new implementation uses the native plotly.js ternary axes

## [3.5.0] - 2019-01-04

### Updated
 - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.43.1. See the
 [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1431----2018-12-21)
 for more information.
 
### Changed
 - Plotly.js 1.43 converted `title` properties (e.g. `layout.title`) from
 strings into compound objects that contain the text as the `text` property
 along with new title placement attributes `x`, `y`, `xref`, `yref`, `xanchor`,
 `yanchor` and `pad`. Plotly.py 3.5.0 follows the new schema, but still
 supports specifying `title` as a string, in which case the string is assigned
 to the `title.text` property
 ([#1302](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1302))
 - Plotly.js 1.43 also moved existing `title*` properties
 (e.g. `layout.titlefont`) under the `title` object (e.g. `layout.title.font`).
 Plotly.py 3.5.0 follows the new schema, but still
 supports the legacy `title*` properties by mapping them to the corresponding
 `title.*` property
 ([#1302](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1302))
 - The `update` method on `graph_objs` now returns the updated object in order
 to support chaining multiple update operations together
 ([#1379](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1379))
 - The `show_link` option has been set to `False` by default in the offline
 `plot` and `iplot` functions. Now that the "send data to cloud" button has
 been disabled by default in plotly.js 1.43.0, no buttons/links will be
 displayed by default that result in data being sent off of the local machine
 ([#1304](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1304))
 - `config` options that are not known by plotly.py result in a warning but are
 still passed along to plotly.js. Prior to this change these unknown options
 were dropped silently
 ([#1290](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1290))
 - Built-in themes now specify colorscales using the new global
 `layout.colorscale` properties.  Previously the colorscales were defined for
 each trace type individually. This reduces the size of the resulting theme
 files 
 ([#1303](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1303))
 - Increased the maximum retry time of the orca integration from 8s to 30s
 ([#1297](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1297))
 
### Fixed
 - Fixed `FigureWidget` performance regression that, when working with
 large datasets, resulted in a slight freeze of the widget after user
 interactions (pan, zoom, etc)
 ([1305](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1305)) 
 - Fix orca error when the `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` environment variable is set
 ([#1293](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1293))
 - The `'responsive'` config key was being silently blocked
 ([#1290](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1290))
 - Fixed error when using unicode characters in string properties on Python 2
 ([#1289](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1289))
 - Removed invalid calls to non-existent `validate` and `strip_style` `Figure`
 methods in matplotlylib conversion logic 
 ([#1128](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1128))
 
## [3.4.2] - 2018-11-23

 for more information.
 
### Added
 - Default figure properties may now be customized using figure
 templates (themes) and 7 new predefined templates are bundled with
 plotly.py
 ([#1224](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1224))
 - Added Parallel Categories (`parcats`) trace type for the visualization
 of multi-dimensional categorical datasets
 ([plotly/plotly.js#2963](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2963))
 - Added LaTeX typesetting support for figures displayed in the Jupyter
 Notebook using `plotly.offline.iplot` and `plotly.graph_objs.FigureWidget`.
 **Note:** There are still outstanding issues with MathJax rendering in FireFox,
 but it is now working well in Chrome.
 ([#1243](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1243))
 - Added `include_mathjax` argument to `plotly.offline.plot` to support
 the creation of HTML files with LaTeX typesetting

  [#1246](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1246))
 - Added new `plotly.offline.get_plotlyjs_version` function that returns
 the version of the bundled plotly.js library
 ([#1246](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1246))
 - HTML div strings returned by `plotly.offline.plot` now contain logic
 to automatically resize the figure responsively.  This logic was previously
 only added for html files.
 ([#1043](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1043),
  [#1234](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1234))

 - Added `'cdn'`, `'directory'`, and path string `include_plotlyjs` options
 in `plotly.offline.plot`
 ([#1234](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1234))
   - When `'cdn'`, the resulting html file/div includes a script tag reference
   to the plotlyjs cdn.
   - When `'directory'`, the resulting html file/div includes a script tag
   reference to a plotly.min.js bundle in the same directory as the html file.
   If `output_type` is `'file'` then this plotly.min.js bundle is created in
   the output directory if it doesn't already exist.
   - When a string ending with `'.js'`, the resulting html file/div includes
   a script tag that references this exact path. This can be used to point
   to a plotly.js bundle from an alternative CDN.
 - Added a new `color_threshold` argument to the `create_dendrogram` figure
 factory to control the dendrogram clustering cutoff
 ([#995](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/995),
  [#1075](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1075),
  [#1214](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1214))

 ([plotly/plotly.js#3068](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3068),
  [plotly/plotly.js#3091](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3091))
 - Added `title`, `titleposition` and `titlefont` attributes to pie traces
 ([plotly/plotly.js#2987](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2987))
 - Added `hoverlabel.split` attribute to `ohlc` and `candlestick` traces to
 split hover labels into multiple pieces
 ([plotly/plotly.js#2959](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2959))
 - Added support for `line.shape` values `'hv'`, `'vh'`, `'hvh'`
 and `'vhv'` in `scattergl` traces
 ([plotly/plotly.js#3087](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3087))

 ([plotly/plotly.js#3068](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3068))


### Fixed
 - Plotly's use of MathJax for LaTeX typesetting no longer interferes with
 the Jupyter Notebook's use of MathJax
 ([#445](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/445), 
  [#360](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/360))
 - Fixed several issues with the use of `reversescale=True` in the
 `create_annotated_heatmap` figure factory
 ([#1251](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1251))
 - Fixed case where `plotly.offline.iplot` would fail to render in the classic
 Jupyter Notebook if the notebook contained a Markdown headline with the text
 "Plotly"
 ([#816](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/816))
 - `None` values in a `scatter.hovertext` list are now omitted from the 
 hover label rather than being displayed as the string `"None"`
 ([#1244](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1244))
 - Subplot titles created by `plotly.tools.make_subplots` are now positioned
 properly when custom `row_width`/`column_width` arguments are specified
 ([#1229](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1229))
 - The `bar.width` property may now be specified as a numpy array or a pandas
 series
 ([#1231](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1231), 
 [plotly/plotly.js#3169](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3169))
 - Error bars are now scaled correctly for logarithmic `scatter3d` traces
 ([#1139](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1139))
 - Use `uuid.uuid4` rather than `uuid.uuid1` to work around an upstream
 Python bug
  ([#1235](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1235),
   [#1236](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1236))
 - The `layout.grid.subplots` property may now be specified as a 2D list of 
 subplot identifiers

   - ipywidgets>=7.2
   - notebook>=5.3
   - jupyterlab==0.35
   
 - JupyterLab Extensions
   - plotlywidget@0.5.0
   - @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.38
   - @jupyterlab/plotly-extension@0.18

## [3.3.0] - 2018-09-28

### Updated
 - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.41.3.  Select highlights included below, see
 [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1413----2018-09-25)
 for more information.
 - Do not create or check permissions on the `~/.plotly` configuration
 directory until a configuration write operation is performed
 ([#1195](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1195)). This change
 avoids some concurrency problems associated with running many instances of
 plotly.py simultaneously
 ([#1068](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1068)).
 
### Added
 - Enable selection by clicking on points via new layout attribute `clickmode` and flag `'select'`
 ([#2944](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2944))
 - Added stacked area charts via new attributes `stackgroup` and `stackgaps` in scatter traces
 ([#2960](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2960))
 - Added `barpolar` trace type - which replace and augment area traces
 ([#2954](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2954))
 - Added `polar.hole` layout parameter to punch hole at the middle of polar
 subplot offsetting the start of the radial range
 ([#2977](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2977), [#2996](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2996))
 - Figures may now be easily converted to and from JSON using the new
 `to_json`, `from_json`, `read_json`, and `write_json` functions in the
 `plotly.io` package
 ([#1188](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1188))
 - Figures and graph objects now support `deepcopy` and `pickle` operations
 ([#1191](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1191))
 - The location of the `"~/.plotly"` settings directory may now be customized
 using the `PLOTLY_DIR` environment variable
 ([#1195](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1195))
 - Added optional `scaleratio` argument to the `create_quiver` figure factory.
 When specified, the axes are restricted to this ratio and the quiver arrows
 are computed to have consistent lengths across angles.
 ([#1197](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1197))
 
### Fixed
 - Replace use of `pkg_resources.resource_string` with `pkgutil.get_data` to
 improve compatibility with `cx_Freeze`
 ([#1201](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1201))
 - An exception is no longer raised when an optional dependency raises an
 exception on import.  The exception is logged and plotly.py continues as if
 the dependency were not installed
 ([#1192](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1192))
 - Fixed invalid dendrogram axis labels when the points being clustered contain
 duplicate values
 ([#1186](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1186))
 - Added missing LICENSE.txt file to PyPI source distribution
 ([#765](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/765))

### JupyterLab Versions
For use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages
must be installed:

 - Python Packages
   - plotly==3.3.0
   - ipywidgets>=7.2
   - notebook>=5.3
   - jupyterlab==0.34
   
 - JupyterLab Extensions
   - plotlywidget@0.4.0
   - @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.37
   - @jupyterlab/plotly-extension@0.17

## [3.2.1] - 2018-09-14
This is a patch release that fixes a few bugs and reintroduces a few
version 2 features that were not supported in version 3.

The bundled version of plotly.js remains at 1.40.1

### JupyterLab Versions
For use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages
must be installed:

 - Python Packages
   - plotly==3.2.1
   - ipywidgets>=7.2
   - notebook>=5.3
   - jupyterlab==0.34
   
 - JupyterLab Extensions
   - plotlywidget@0.3.0
   - @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.37
   - @jupyterlab/plotly-extension@0.17

### Added
 - An optional `skip_invalid` argument has been added to the `Figure` and
  `FigureWidget` constructors. By default, `skip_invalid` is `False` and invalid
  figure properties will result in an exception (this is identical to the
  previous behavior).  When `skip_invalid` is set to `True`, invalid properties
  will instead be silently ignored. This argument replaces the `_raise`
  argument that was available in version 2, and makes it possible to import
  figure definitions from different plotly versions, where incompatible
  properties are ignored rather than causing an exception.
 - A `to_ordered_dict` method has been added to the `Figure` and `FigureWidget`
  classes. This method returns a representation of the figure as a nested
  structure of `OrdererdDict` and `list` instances where the keys in each
  `OrderedDict` are sorted alphabetically.  This method replaces the
  `get_ordered` method that was available in version 2, and makes it possible
  to traverse the nested structure of a figure in a deterministic order.

### Fixed
 - Pandas `Series` and `Index` objects storing `datetime` values were
   incorrectly cast to numeric arrays
   ([plotly/plotly.py#1160](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1160),
    [plotly/plotly.py#1163](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1163))
 - Numpy arrays with `uint64` datatype caused a `FigureWidget` error,
   and no figure was displayed
   ([plotly/plotly.py#1155](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1155),
    [plotly/plotly.py#1163](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1163))

## [3.2.0] - 2018-09-05
This release introduces the long-anticipated ability to programmatically
export figures as high quality static images in both raster and vector
formats.

### JupyterLab Versions (Python 3.5+)

      ([plotly/plotly.js#2895](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2895))
    - Add layout attributes `piecolorway` and `extendpiecolors` for more control over pie colors
      ([plotly/plotly.js#2870](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2870))
    - Add `splom` attribute `dimensions[i].axis.type` to easily override axis type in splom-generated axes
      ([plotly/plotly.js#2899](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2870))
    - Add support for on-graph text in `scatterpolargl` traces
      ([plotly/plotly.js#2895](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2895))
    - See [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1400----2018-08-16)
      for bug fixes and more information.
 - Support for offline static image export with the `to_image` and `write_image`
   functions in the new `plotly.io` package ([#1120](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1120)).
    - Note: Image export requires the plotly [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca)
      command line utility and the [`psutil`](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) Python package.
 - New documentation sections covering [Static Image Export](https://plot.ly/python/static-image-export/)
   and [Orca Management](https://plot.ly/python/orca-management/) 
 - Support for displaying `FigureWidget` instances in static contexts

 ([#1117](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1117))
 - Full integration of the Cividis colorscale ([#883](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/883))
 - conda packaging
   - From here forward, new versions of plotly.py will be published to the [plotly anaconda channel](https://anaconda.org/plotly/)
     on the same day they are published to PyPI.
     ([72ad0e4](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/commit/72ad0e4bf54bb8a06445d2ca55488ffc11c836a7))
   - The [`README`](packages/python/plotly-geo/README.md) now includes conda installation instructions alongside the pip instructions. 
   - In addition to the existing installation approaches, orca is now also available as a
     [conda package](https://anaconda.org/plotly/plotly-orca) from the plotly anaconda channel.
 
### Updated
 - Show traces at the top of the Gantt chart's colorbar ([#1110](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1110))
 - Significantly improved validation performance for numeric pandas `Series` objects ([#1149](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1149))

## [3.0.2] - 2018-07-17
This is a minor bug-fix release to 3.0.0

### JupyterLab plotlywidget version: 0.1.1

### Plotly.js version: 1.38.3

### Fixed
 - Several errors related to numbered subplot labels (e.g. xaxis2, polar3, etc.)
   [GH1057](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1057)
 - Error where the `v` property was ignored in `cone` traces
   [GH1060](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1060)
 - Assorted performance improvements when constructing graph objects
   [GH1061](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1061)
   
## [3.0.1] - 2018-07-17 [YANKED]
Note: This release's installation was broken. It has been removed from PyPI

## [3.0.0] - 2018-07-05

This is a major version with many exciting updates. See the [Introducing plotly.py 3.0.0](https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-plotly-py-3-0-0-7bb1333f69c6) post for more information.

### JupyterLab plotlywidget version: 0.1.1

### Plotly.js version: 1.38.3

### Added
- Full Jupyter ipywidgets integration with the new `graph_objs.FigureWidget` class
- `FigureWidget` figures can be updated interactively using property assignment syntax
- The full trace and layout API is generated from the plotly schema to provide a great experience for interactive use in the notebook
- Support for setting array properties as numpy arrays. When numpy arrays are used, ipywidgets binary serialization protocol is used to avoid converting these to JSON strings.
- Context manager API for animation. Run `help(go.Figure().batch_animate)` for the full doc string.
- Perform automatic retries when communicating with plot.ly services. This introduces a new required dependency on the [retrying](https://pypi.org/project/retrying/) library.
- Improved data validation covering the full API with clear, informative error messages. This means that incorrect properties and/or values now always raise a `ValueError` with a description of the error, the invalid property, and the available properties on the level that it was placed in the graph object. Eg. `go.Scatter(foo=123)` raises a validation error. See https://plot.ly/python/reference/ for a reference to all valid properties and values in the Python API.
- Error message for `plotly.figure_factory.create_choropleth` is now helpful to Anaconda users who do not have the correct modules installed for the County Choropleth figure factory.

## [2.0.5] - 2017-03-07
### Fixed
- `import plotly` was broken in `2.0.3` and `2.0.2` because the new `dashboard_objs` wasn't included in our `setup.py`'s "`packages`". Now it is and `import plotly` and the other features introduced in `2.0.3` and `2.0.2` should work.

You can learn more about `Dashboard` objects by running `help(plotly.dashboard_objs)` and `help(plotly.plotly.plotly.dashboard_ops)` for uploading and retrieving dashboards from the cloud.


## [2.0.2] - 2017-02-20
### Fixed
- Offline plots created with `plotly.offline.plot` now resize as expected when the window is resized.
- `plotly.figure_factory.create_distplot` now can support more than 10 traces without raising an error. Updated so that if the list of `colors` (default colors too) is less than your number of traces, the color for your traces will loop around to start when it hits the end.

## [2.0.1] - 2017-02-07
### Added
- Support for rendering plots in [nteract](https://nteract.io/)!
  See [https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/662](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/662)
  for the associated PR in nteract.
- As part of the above, plotly output now prints with a [custom mimetype](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/blob/f65724f06b894a5db94245ee4889c632b887d8ce/plotly/offline/offline.py#L348) - `application/vnd.plotly.v1+json`
- `memoize` decorator added to `plotly.utils`

### Changed
- a `Grid` from `plotly.grid_objs` now accepts a `pandas.Dataframe` as its argument.
- computationally-intensive `graph_reference` functions are memoized.

## [2.0.0] - 2017-01-25
### Changed
- `plotly.exceptions.PlotlyRequestException` is *always* raised for network
failures. Previously either a `PlotlyError`, `PlotlyRequestException`, or a
`requests.exceptions.ReqestException` could be raised. In particular, scripts
which depend on `try-except` blocks containing network requests should be
revisited.
- `plotly.py:sign_in` now validates to the plotly server specified in your
  config. If it cannot make a successful request, it raises a `PlotlyError`.
- `plotly.figure_factory` will raise an `ImportError` if `numpy` is not
  installed.
- `plotly.figure_factory.create_violin()` now has a `rugplot` parameter which
  determines whether or not a rugplot is draw beside each violin plot.

### Deprecated
- `plotly.tools.FigureFactory`. Use `plotly.figure_factory.*`.
- (optional imports) `plotly.tools._*_imported` It was private anyhow, but now
it's gone. (e.g., `_numpy_imported`)
- (plotly v2 helper) `plotly.py._api_v2` It was private anyhow, but now it's
gone.

## [1.13.0] - 2016-12-17

## [1.12.12] - 2016-12-06
### Updated
- Updated `plotly.min.js` to version 1.20.5 for `plotly.offline`.
  - See [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for additional information regarding the updates.
- `FF.create_scatterplotmatrix` now by default does not show the trace labels for the box plots, only if `diag=box` is selected for the diagonal subplot type.

## [1.12.11] - 2016-12-01
### Fixed
- The `link text` in the bottom right corner of the offline plots now properly displays `Export to [Domain Name]` for the given domain name set in the users' `.config` file.

## [1.12.10] - 2016-11-28
### Updated
- `FF.create_violin` and `FF.create_scatterplotmatrix` now by default do not print subplot grid information in output
- Removed alert that occured when downloading plot images offline. Please note: for higher resolution images and more export options, consider making requests to our image servers. See: `help(py.image)` for more details.

### Added
- Plot configuration options for offline plots. See the list of [configuration options](https://github.com/Rikorose/plotly.py/blob/master/plotly/offline/offline.py#L189) and [examples](https://plot.ly/javascript/configuration-options/) for more information.
  - Please note that these configuration options are for offline plots ONLY. For configuration options when embedding online plots please see our [embed tutorial](http://help.plot.ly/embed-graphs-in-websites/#step-8-customize-the-iframe).
- `colors.py` file which contains functions for manipulating and validating colors and arrays of colors
- 'scale' param in `FF.create_trisurf` which now can set the interpolation on the colorscales
- animations now work in offline mode. By running `plotly.offline.plot()` and `plotly.offline.iplot()` with a `fig` with `frames`, the resulting plot will cycle through the figures defined in `frames` either in the browser or in an ipython notebook respectively. Here's an example:
```
import IPython.display
from IPython.display import display, HTML
from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot
init_notebook_mode(connected=True)

figure_or_data = {'data': [{'x': [1, 2], 'y': [0, 1]}],
                  'layout': {'xaxis': {'range': [0, 3], 'autorange': False},
                             'yaxis': {'range': [0, 20], 'autorange': False},
                  'title': 'First Title'},
                  'frames': [{'data': [{'x': [1, 2], 'y': [5, 7]}]},
                             {'data': [{'x': [-1, 3], 'y': [3, 9]}]},
                             {'data': [{'x': [2, 2.6], 'y': [7, 5]}]},
                             {'data': [{'x': [1.5, 3], 'y': [7.5, 4]}]},
                             {'data': [{'x': [1, 2], 'y': [0, 1]}],
                              'layout': {'title': 'End Title'}}]}
iplot(figure_or_data)
```
More examples can be found at https://plot.ly/python/animations/.
- animations now work in online mode: use `plotly.plotly.create_animations` and `plotly.plotly.icreate_animations` which animate a figure with the `frames` argument. Here is a simple example:
```
import plotly.plotly as py
from plotly.grid_objs import Grid, Column

column_1 = Column([0.5], 'x')
column_2 = Column([0.5], 'y')
column_3 = Column([1.5], 'x2')
column_4 = Column([1.5], 'y2')

grid = Grid([column_1, column_2, column_3, column_4])
py.grid_ops.upload(grid, 'ping_pong_grid', auto_open=False)

# create figure
figure = {
    'data': [
        {
            'xsrc': grid.get_column_reference('x'),
            'ysrc': grid.get_column_reference('y'),
            'mode': 'markers',
        }
    ],
    'layout': {'title': 'Ping Pong Animation',
               'xaxis': {'range': [0, 2], 'autorange': False},
               'yaxis': {'range': [0, 2], 'autorange': False},
               'updatemenus': [{
                   'buttons': [
                       {'args': [None],
                        'label': u'Play',
                        'method': u'animate'}
               ],
               'pad': {'r': 10, 't': 87},
               'showactive': False,
               'type': 'buttons'
                }]},
    'frames': [
        {
            'data': [
                {
                    'xsrc': grid.get_column_reference('x2'),
                    'ysrc': grid.get_column_reference('y2'),
                    'mode': 'markers',
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            'data': [
                {
                    'xsrc': grid.get_column_reference('x'),
                    'ysrc': grid.get_column_reference('y'),
                    'mode': 'markers',
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

py.create_animations(figure, 'ping_pong')
```

### Fixed
- Trisurf now uses correct `Plotly Colorscales` when called
- Fixed a bug in the format of unique-identifiers in columns of grids that are uploaded to plotly via `plotly.plotly.upload`. See https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/599 for details. In particular, creating plots that are based off of plotly grids is no longer broken. Here is an example:

```
import plotly.plotly as py
from plotly.grid_objs import Grid, Column

c1 = Column([6, 6, 6, 5], 'column 1')
c2 = Column(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 'column 2')
g = Grid([c1, c2])

# Upload the grid
py.grid_ops.upload(g, 'my-grid', auto_open=False)

# Make a graph that with data that is referenced from that grid
trace = Scatter(xsrc=g[0], ysrc=g[1])
url = py.plot([trace], filename='my-plot')
```
Then, whenever you update the data in `'my-grid'`, the associated plot will update too. See https://plot.ly/python/data-api for more details on usage and examples.

## [1.12.9] - 2016-08-22
### Fixed
- the colorbar in `.create_trisurf` now displays properly in `offline mode`.

### Updated
- the colorbar in `.create_trisurf` now displays the appropriate max and min values on the ends of the bar which corresponding to the coloring metric of the figure
- `edges_color` is now a param in `.create_trisurf` which only takes `rgb` values at the moment

## [1.12.8] - 2016-08-18
### Fixed
- Fixed color bug with trisurf plots where certain triangles were colored strangely. The coordinates of `rgb(...)` are now rounded to their nearest integer (using Python3 method of rounding), then placed in the color string to fix the issue.

## [1.12.7] - 2016-08-17
### Fixed
- Edited `plotly.min.js` due to issue using `iplot` to plot offline in Jupyter Notebooks
  - Please note that `plotly.min.js` may be cached in your Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, if you continue to experience this issue after upgrading the Plotly package please open a new notebook or clear the cache to ensure the correct `plotly.min.js` is referenced.

## [1.11.0] - 2016-05-27
### Updated
- Changed the default option for `create_distplot` in the figure factory from `probability` to `probability density` and also added the `histnorm` parameter to allow the user to choose between the two options.
Note: This is a backwards incompatible change.

- Updated plotly.min.js so the offline mode is using plotly.js v1.12.0
  - Light position is now configurable in surface traces
  - surface and mesh3d lighting attributes are now accompanied with comprehensive descriptions

- Allowed `create_scatterplotmatrix` and `create_trisurf` to use divergent and categorical colormaps. The parameter `palette` has been replaced by `colormap` and `use_palette` has been removed. In `create_scatterplotmatrix`, users can now:
  - Input a list of different color types (hex, tuple, rgb) to `colormap` to map colors divergently
  - Use the same list to categorically group the items in the index column
  - Pass a singlton color type to `colormap` to color all the data with one color
  - Input a dictionary to `colormap` to map index values to a specific color
  - 'cat' and 'seq' are valid options for `colormap_type`, which specify the type of colormap being used

- In `create_trisurf`, the parameter `dist_func` has been replaced by `color_func`. Users can now:
  - Input a list of different color types (hex, tuple, rgb) to `colormap` to map colors divergently
  - Input a list|array of hex and rgb colors to `color_func` to assign each simplex to a color

### Added
- Added the option to load plotly.js from a CDN by setting the parameter `connected=True`
 in the `init_notebook_mode()` function call
- The FigureFactory can now create trisurf plots with `.create_trisurf`. Check it out with:
```
import plotly.tools as tls
help(tls.FigureFactory.create_trisurf)
```



## [1.10.0] - 2016-05-19
### Fixed
- Version 1.9.13 fixed an issue in offline mode where if you ran `init_notebook_mode`
more than once the function would skip importing (because it saw that it had
already imported the library) but then accidentally clear plotly.js from the DOM.
This meant that if you ran `init_notebook_mode` more than once, your graphs would
not appear when you refreshed the page.
Version 1.9.13 solved this issue by injecting plotly.js with every iplot call.
While this works, it also injects the library excessively, causing notebooks
to have multiple versions of plotly.js inline in the DOM, potentially making
notebooks with many `iplot` calls very large.
Version 1.10.0 brings back the requirement to call `init_notebook_mode` before
making an `iplot` call. It makes `init_notebook_mode` idempotent: you can call
it multiple times without worrying about losing your plots on refresh.


## [1.9.13] - 2016-05-19
### Fixed
- Fixed issue in offline mode related to the inability to reload plotly.js on page refresh and extra init_notebook_mode calls.

## [1.9.12] - 2016-05-16
### Added
- SSL support for streaming.

## [1.9.11] - 2016-05-02
### Added
- The FigureFactory can now create scatter plot matrices with `.create_scatterplotmatrix`. Check it out with:

## [1.9.9] - 2016-04-15
### Fixed
- Fixed `require is not defined` issue when plotting offline outside of Ipython Notebooks.

## [1.9.8] - 2016-04-14
### Fixed

### Updated
- Updated plotly.min.js so offline is using plotly.js v1.9.0
  - Added Ternary plots with support for scatter traces (trace type `scatterternary`, currently only available in offline mode)
  - For comprehensive update list see the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## [1.9.7] - 2016-04-04

  - For comprehensive update list see the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## [1.9.6] - 2016-02-18
### Updated
- Updated plotly.min.js so offline is using plotly.js v1.5.2

## [1.9.5] - 2016-01-17
### Added
- Offline matplotlib to Plotly figure conversion. Use `offline.plot_mpl` to convert and plot a matplotlib figure as a Plotly figure independently of IPython/Jupyter notebooks or use `offline.iplot_mpl` to convert and plot inside of IPython/Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, use `offline.enable_mpl_offline` to convert and plot all matplotlib figures as plotly figures inside an IPython/Jupyter notebook. See examples below:

An example independent of IPython/Jupyter notebooks:
```
from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, plot_mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

init_notebook_mode()

fig = plt.figure()
x = [10, 15, 20]
y = [100, 150, 200]
plt.plot(x, y, "o")

plot_mpl(fig)
```

An example inside of an IPython/Jupyter notebook:
```
from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot_mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

init_notebook_mode()

fig = plt.figure()
x = [10, 15, 20]
y = [100, 150, 200]
plt.plot(x, y, "o")

iplot_mpl(fig)
```

An example of enabling all matplotlib figures to be converted to
Plotly figures inside of an IPython/Jupyter notebook:
```
from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, enable_mpl_offline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

init_notebook_mode()
enable_mpl_offline()

fig = plt.figure()
x = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
y = [100, 250, 200, 150, 300]
plt.plot(x, y, "o")
fig
```

## [1.9.4] - 2016-01-11
### Added
- Offline plotting now works outside of the IPython/Jupyter notebook. Here's an example:
```
from plotly.offline import plot
from plotly.graph_objs import Scatter

plot([Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[3, 1, 6])])
```

This command works entirely locally. It writes to a local HTML file with the necessary [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript) code to render the graph. Your browser will open the file after you make the call.

The call signature is very similar to `plotly.offline.iplot` and `plotly.plotly.plot` and `plotly.plotly.iplot`, so you can basically use these commands interchangeably.

If you want to publish your graphs to the web, use `plotly.plotly.plot`, as in:

```
import plotly.plotly as py
from plotly.graph_objs import Scatter

py.plot([Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[5, 1, 6])])
```

This will upload the graph to your online plotly account.

## [1.9.3] - 2015-12-08
### Added
- Check for `no_proxy` when determining if the streaming request should pass through a proxy in the chunked_requests submodule. Example: `no_proxy='my_stream_url'` and `http_proxy=my.proxy.ip:1234`, then `my_stream_url` will not get proxied. Previously it would.

## [1.9.2] - 2015-11-30
**Bug Fix**: Previously, the "Export to plot.ly" link on
offline charts would export your figures to the
public plotly cloud, even if your `config_file`
(set with `plotly.tools.set_config_file` to the file
`~/.plotly/.config`) set `plotly_domain` to a plotly enterprise
URL like `https://plotly.acme.com`.

This is now fixed. Your graphs will be exported to your
`plotly_domain` if it is set.

## [1.9.1] - 2015-11-26
### Added
- The FigureFactory can now create annotated heatmaps with `.create_annotated_heatmap`. Check it out with:
```
import plotly.tools as tls
help(tls.FigureFactory.create_annotated_heatmap)
```
- The FigureFactory can now create tables with `.create_table`.
```
import plotly.tools as tls
help(tls.FigureFactory.create_table)
```

## [1.9.0] - 2015-11-15
- Previously, using plotly offline required a paid license.
No more: `plotly.js` is now shipped inside this package to allow
unlimited free use of plotly inside the ipython notebook environment.
The `plotly.js` library that is included in this package is free,
open source, and maintained independently on GitHub at
[https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js).
- The `plotly.js` bundle that is required for offline use is no longer downloaded
and installed independently from this package: `plotly.offline.download_plotlyjs`
is **deprecated**.
- New versions of `plotly.js` will be tested and incorporated
  into this package as new versioned pip releases;
  `plotly.js` is not automatically kept in sync with this package.

## [1.8.12] - 2015-11-02
- *Big data* warning mentions `plotly.graph_objs.Scattergl` as possible solution.

## [1.8.9] - 2015-10-11
- If you're behind a proxy, you can make requests by setting the environmental variable HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/v1.0.4/user/advanced/#proxies). This didn't work for streaming, but now it does.

## [1.8.8] - 2015-10-05
- Sometimes creating a graph with a private share-key doesn't work -
the graph is private, but not accessible with the share key.
Now we check to see if it didn't work, and re-try a few times until
it does.

## [1.8.7] - 2015-10-01
### Added
- The FigureFactory can now create dendrogram plots with `.create_dendrogram`.

## [1.8.6] - 2015-09-28
### Fixed
- Saving "world_readable" to your config file via `plotly.tools.set_config` actually works.

### Added
- You can also save `auto_open` and `sharing` to the config file so that you can forget these
  keyword argument in `py.iplot` and `py.plot`.

## [1.8.5] - 2015-09-29
### Fixed
- Fixed validation errors (validate=False workaround no longer required)

### Added
- Auto-sync API request on import to get the latest schema from Plotly
- `.`-access for nested attributes in plotly graph objects
- General `.help()` method for plotly graph objects
- Specific attribute `.help(<attribute>)` also included

### Removed
- No more *is streamable*, streaming validation.

## [1.8.3] - 2015-08-14
### Fixed
- Fixed typos in `plot` and `iplot` documentations

## [1.8.2] - 2015-08-11
### Added
- CHANGELOG
- `sharing` keyword argument for `plotly.plotly.plot` and `plotly.plotly.iplot` with options `'public' | 'private' | 'secret'` to control the privacy of the charts. Depreciates `world_readable`

### Changed
- If the response from `plot` or `iplot` contains an error message, raise an exception

### Removed
- `height` and `width` are no longer accepted in `iplot`. Just stick them into your figure's layout instead, it'll be more consistent when you view it outside of the IPython notebook environment. So, instead of this:

  ```
  py.iplot([{'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [3, 1, 5]}], height=800)
  ```

  do this:

  ```
  py.iplot({
    'data': [{'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [3, 1, 5]}],
    'layout': {'height': 800}
  })
  ```

### Fixed
- The height of the graph in `iplot` respects the figure's height in layout
