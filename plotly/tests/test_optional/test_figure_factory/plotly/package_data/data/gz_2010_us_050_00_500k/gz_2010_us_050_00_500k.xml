         <abstract>The 2010 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER geographic database. These boundary files are specifically designed for small scale thematic mapping. When possible generalization is performed with intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based shapefiles while others are available only as state-based files. </abstract>
         <purpose>To improve the appearance of shapes at small scales, areas are represented with fewer vertices than detailed TIGER/Line equivalents.  These boundary files take up less disk space than their ungeneralized counterparts.  Cartographic boundary files take less time to render on screen.  These files were specifically created to support small-scale thematic mapping.</purpose>

         <attraccr>Accurate against American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Publication INCITS 446-2008 (Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)) at the 100% level for the codes and base names present in the file.  Some entities may have NULL name and/or Legal/Statistical Area Description (LSAD) attribution and this does not imply, in all cases, that the entities do not have names and/or LSADs.

      <logic>The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency of the source database.  Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area.  All polygons were tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed geographic update system to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census MAF/TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts are used when encoding spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files.  Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.</logic>
      <complete>The Cartographic Boundary Files are generalized representations of extracts taken from the MAF/TIGER Database. Generalized boundary files are clipped to a simplified version of the U.S. outline. As a result, some off-shore areas may be excluded from the generalized files. Some small holes or discontiguous parts of areas are not included in generalized files.</complete>

      <overview>
         <eaover>The 2010 cartographic boundary polygon shapefiles contain boundary data for a specific type of Census geography.  See the U.S. Census Bureau Geographic Terms and Concepts documentation for further explanation of Census geography (http://www.census.gov/geo/www/2010census/GTC_10.pdf).  

Field names, descriptions and data types are listed in this format:  FIELD_NAME Description [data value or type].

At a miniumum, the following four fields will appear in every file: GEO_ID Unique identifier for a geographic entity [alphanumeric]; LSAD Standard abbreviation translation of Legal/Statistical Area Description (LSAD) code as used on census maps [alpha]; NAME Name without translated Legal/Statistical Area Description (LSAD) [alphanumeric]; CENSUSAREA Area of entity before generalization in square miles [numeric].  The CENSUSAREA field is the calculated area derived from the ungeneralized area of each entity.  This field can be used in density calculations.  Users should not calculate the area of the generalized polygons for use in any analysis.  Use the GEO_ID field to join these spatial tables to 2010 Census data tables.  NAME and/or LSAD may be NULL.  This does not imply the entities do not have names and/or LSADs but rather the names and/or LSADs may not have been populated for a given file.

Additional attribution for a shapefile will vary depending on the fields appropriate for a given type of geography.  These fields may include:  AIANHH American Indian Area/Alaska Native Area/Hawaiian Home Land [4-digit Census code]; AIHHTLI American Indian Trust Land/Hawaiian Home Land Indicator ['R' for reservation, 'T' for off-reservation trust land], AITSCE American Indian Tribal Subdivision [3-digit Census code]; ANRC Alaska Native Regional Corporation [5-digit FIPS code]; BLKGRP Block Group [1-digit Census code]; CBSA Metropolitan Statistical Area/Micropolitan Statistical Area [5-digit FIPS code]; CD Congressional District [2-digit FIPS code]; CNECTA Combined New England City and Town Area [3-digit FIPS code]; CONCIT Consolidated City [5-digit FIPS code]; COUNTY County [3-digit FIPS code]; COUSUB County Subdivision [5-digit FIPS code]; CSA Combined Statistical Area [3-digit Census code]; DIVISION Census Division [1-digit Census code]; METDIV Metropolitan Division [5-digit FIPS code];  NECTA New England City and Town Area [5-digit FIPS code]; NECTADIV New England City and Town Area Division [5-digit FIPS code]; PLACE Place [5-digit FIPS code]; REGION Census Region [1-digit Census code]; SDELM Elementary School District [5-digit Local Education Agency code]; SDSEC Secondary School District [5-digit Local Education Agency code]; SDUNI Unified School District [5-digit Local Education Agency code]; SLDL State Legislative District (Lower Chamber) [alphanumeric]; SLDU State Legislative District (Upper Chamber) [alphanumeric]; STATE State [2-digit FIPS code]; SUBMCD Subminor Civil Division [5-digit FIPS code] TBLKGRP Tribal Block Group [1-digit alphanumeric]; TRACT Tract [6-digit Census code]; TTRACT Tribal Census Tract [6-digit Census code]; VTD Voting District [alphanumeric]; ZCTA5 ZIP Code Tabulation Area [5-digit Census code].  

Some nation-based files may include Puerto Rico and the Island Areas of the United States.  Island areas include American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Northern Mariana Islands), and the United States Virgin Islands.</eaover>
