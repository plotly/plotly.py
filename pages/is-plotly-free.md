It costs nothing to [install and use](/python/getting-started). You can view the source, report issues or contribute using [our Github repository](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py).

## Can I use Plotly for Python without signing up to any service?

&nbsp;  &nbsp; **Yes.** &nbsp; You can use Plotly for Python to make, view, and distribute charts and maps without registering for any service,
obtaining any token, or creating any account. The one exception is that to view tile maps
which use tiles from the Mapbox service (which is optional, as [you can use other tile servers](/python/mapbox-layers)), you will need to have a Mapbox token.

## Can I use Plotly for Python offline, without being connected to the internet?

&nbsp;  &nbsp; **Yes.** &nbsp; You can use Plotly for Python to make, view, and distribute graphics totally offline. The one exception is that to view tile maps
