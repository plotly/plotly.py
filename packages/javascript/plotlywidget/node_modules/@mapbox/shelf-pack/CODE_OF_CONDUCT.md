# Contributor Code of Conduct

#### Guidelines

* Please be respectful to one another.
* Many contributors are volunteering their time.  We might not get to your
issue right away.  Be patient.
* Other contributors have different backgrounds and perspectives than you do.
Diversity is a community strength.
* We will disagree sometimes.  That's ok.  When this happens, assume that the
person with whom you disagree is a smart person with good reasons for believing
something different.
* Everyone has bad days.  If you find yourself about to be mean to someone,
take a break and cool off.  This project will still be here later.
* When you make a mistake, apologize.


#### We will not tolerate

* Sexualized language or imagery
* Hate speech
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information
* Plagiarism
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

#### Enforcement

Project maintainers commit themselves to fairly enforcing this Code of Conduct.
This means we may:

* Edit or delete harmful comments, code, issues, or other contributions
* Ban harmful users from the project, temporarily or permanently

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an
individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported privately to the project maintainers.
