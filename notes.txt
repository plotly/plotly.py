-   Can we get rid of `plotly/api` entirely?
-   Can we eliminate `plotly/conftest.py` and fix breaking tests?
-   Why the distinction between `graph_objects` and `graph_objs`?
    -   Historical reasons, but `graph_objs` is widely used.
    -   Generate code into `graph_objects` and have `graph_objs` point at it
        instead of vice versa.
-   Switch focus for now to the main documentation in `./doc`.

-   Ran this to create a `.ipynb` file:

```
jupytext --to ipynb --execute --output pages/strip-charts.ipynb doc/python/strip-charts.md
```

-   Loading the notebook like this, the charts don't show up:

```
jupyter notebook pages/strip-charts.ipynb
```

-   Had to add this in a cell at the top:

```
import plotly.io as pio
pio.renderers.default = "notebook"
```

-   `mkdocs build` produces many (many) lines like this that did *not* appear
    before `mkdocs-jupyter` was added to `mkdocs.yml`:

```
[WARNING] Div at /var/folders/w2/l51fjbjd25n9zbwkz9fw9jp00000gn/T/tmpgvlxh1sq line 3 column 1 unclosed at /var/folders/w2/l51fjbjd25n9zbwkz9fw9jp00000gn/T/tmpgvlxh1sq line 6 column 1, closing implicitly.
```

-   But with the `plotly.io` line, the `.ipynb` file is converted to usable HTML.
    -   Still clearly originated as a notebook, but the chart shows up.
