## Installation

plotly.py may be installed using pip

```
pip install plotly
```

or conda.

```
conda install -c plotly plotly
```

### Jupyter Widget Support

For use as a Jupyter widget, install `jupyter` and `anywidget`
packages using `pip`:

```
pip install jupyter anywidget
```

or `conda`:

```
conda install jupyter anywidget
```

### Static Image Export

plotly.py supports [static image export](https://plotly.com/python/static-image-export/),
using either the [`kaleido`](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido)
package (recommended, supported as of `plotly` version 4.9) or the [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca)
command line utility (legacy as of `plotly` version 4.9).

#### Kaleido

The [`kaleido`](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido) package has no dependencies and can be installed
using pip

```
pip install -U kaleido
```

or conda

```
conda install -c conda-forge python-kaleido
```

### Extended Geo Support

Some plotly.py features rely on fairly large geographic shape files. The county
choropleth figure factory is one such example. These shape files are distributed as a
separate `plotly-geo` package. This package can be installed using pip...

```
pip install plotly-geo==1.0.0
```

or conda

```
conda install -c plotly plotly-geo=1.0.0
```
