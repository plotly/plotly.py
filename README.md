Python-api: Data Visualization and Analytics 
======

Plotly's scientific graphing libraries let you make and share interactive, publication-quality graphs
in your web browser. That means you can interface Plotly's online graphing tools with your desktop environment, 
easily sending or streaming data to your graphs in your web browser. 

You can both style with code and with our online interface. And Plotly also offers a Python Shell (NumPy suppported) and statistical tools for analalzing your data. 
And Plotly also makes it easy to post and share your data and graphs, together, publicly with a url or privately with your team.
